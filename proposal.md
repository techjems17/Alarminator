# Project Description
Set your alarm and go to bed (you will only need one alarm to wake up in the morning). Once your alarm goes off there will be a loud sound fallowed by a puzzle. Solve the puzzle to turn off your alarm.

## Problem statement
Do you hav trouble getting up in the morning? Do you have 2, 5, maybe even 10 alarms set just to get up for work or school? Or do you constantly press snooze on your alarm clock? Then this app is for you!

## How will your project solve this problem?
The best way to wake up in the morning is by waking up your mind. With this app you will solve a puzzle to turn off the alarm, therefore waking up your mind. Chances are you will be so awake after the loud sounds and challenging your mind to solve a puzzle that you will be able to get up and get started with your day right away.

## Map the user experience
User will set the alarm time desired. User can then go to bed, or take a nap, or what ever they wish. Once the alarm time comes the alarm will sound and a puzzle will show up. Once the alarm shows up the user will then have to complete the puzzle in order for the alarm to turn off.
